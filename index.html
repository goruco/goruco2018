        <p><p>Programming history is filled with bugs that turned out to be features and limitations that pushed developers to make even more interesting products. We’ll journey through code that was so ‘bad’ it was actually good. Along the way we&#39;ll look at the important role failure plays in learning. Then we’ll tame our inner perfectionists and tackle an approach to writing code that will help us fail spectacularly on our way to coding success.</p></p>

        <h4>Analyzing and Reducing Ruby Memory Usage</h4>
        <p><p>Memory usage can be difficult to analyze.  In this presentation we will cover different techniques for analyzing memory usage of a Ruby process including in-process analysis tools as well as system level tools.  After doing memory analysis, we&#39;ll look at some ways to reduce overall memory used by the system.  Attendees will leave with practical tips and tricks for memory analysis in their Ruby systems, as well as a better understanding of Ruby internals.</p></p>

        <h4>Evented Autonomous Services in Ruby</h4>
        <p><p>Whether you call it microservices or SOA, service autonomy is the quality of the architecture that dictates whether you end up with the services implementation of your dreams, or a tangled mess. Event Sourcing is the path of least resistance to service architecture, and the only way to realize the service autonomy that keeps your efforts from going off the rails. With examples of service components produced entirely in Ruby, this presentation describes the patterns and anti patterns of service architecture, and demonstrates the basics of message and event-oriented design, development, and testing.</p></p>

        <h4>I've Made a Huge Mistake: We Did Services All Wrong</h4>
        <p><p>In the recent years, microservices have been an investment among many engineering teams as they scale. They are often the default of many new companies. But how has that gone wrong? <p>This talk will dive into how one company refined their thinking on their service-based architecture for the better. It will cover reasoning about services; drawing boundaries in large Rails applications; the differences between services and applications; and when to finally extract a new application.</p></p>

        <p><p>These days new Ruby releases are regarded with less and less fanfare. We rejoiced at all the new features and support of Ruby 1.9 and 2.0! Since then, we've become a bit jaded: <em>&quot;Refinements? Yeah, they&#39;re OK.&quot; &quot;Immutable String pragma? Yawn!&quot; &quot;<code>yield_self</code>? Don't we already have <code>tap</code>?</em></p> <p>In fact, Ruby has delivered in myriad ways over the last several releases. From more support for functional-style programming to vast speed improvements, the Ruby core team is firing on all cylinders.
