<h3>Mission</h3>

  GORUCO’s diversity scholarship program aims to support
  traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized people
  in the Ruby community (including, but not limited to
  people identifying as women, people of color, LGBT, and/or
  people with disabilities) who may not otherwise have the opportunity
  to attend the conference for financial reasons.</p>

  We want you at the conference, and we want to help you get there.</p>
