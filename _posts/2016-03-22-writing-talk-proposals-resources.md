  We have included eleven articles and resources about writing talk proposals
  in no specific order below for your reading pleasure.
</p>

<p>
  If you do not feel like reading all of these, the major takeaways are
  to think more about what people will get out of your talk, rather than what
  the talk will cover.
  Direct the proposal to the attendees.
  Try to tell a story.
  Sell the benefit.
  Be specific and succinct about your point and the question it will answer.
