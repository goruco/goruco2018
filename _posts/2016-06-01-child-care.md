<p>
  Attention Parents! We are happy to announce that we will be offering child care, free of charge,
  to anyone who requires it in order to attend our conference.
  Child care will be available for the duration of the conference and
  provided by <a href="https://www.sittercity.com/">SitterCity</a>.</p>

<p>
  If you are on the fence about whether or not to attend,
  we want to make sure that a lack of child care
  is not going to keep you from being there.</p>

<p>
  If you are considering taking advantage of our child care offering,
  please fill out <a href="https://goruco.wufoo.com/forms/z1fkmw010pouy7s/">this form</a>
  and we will get in touch with you.
  We need to let SitterCity know details and numbers by two weeks before the conference,
  that means you have until Friday, June 10th to make your decision.
  That is nine days from now, but why wait?</p>
