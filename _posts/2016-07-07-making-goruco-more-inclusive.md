title: Making GORUCO more inclusive
---

<p>
  Over the years GORUCO has invested considerable time, energy, and resources
  into diversity and inclusion initiatives.
  Here is what we have done this year.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>
  We offered <a href="http://goruco.com/2016/discounted-goruco-tickets">discounted
  tickets</a> for those who identify as belonging to a group that is
  underrepresented in the technology industry. Thank you <a
  href="http://www.stridenyc.com/">Stride</a> for sponsoring this.</p>

<p>
  We once again ran a <a href="http://goruco.com/2016/announcing-scholarship-applications">diversity
  scholarship program</a>. The program aims to support traditionally
  underrepresented and/or marginalized persons in the Ruby community who may not
  otherwise have the opportunity to attend the conference for financial reasons.
  This year we have 16 successful scholarship applicants. As part of the program
  we asked other attendees if they will be willing to be scholarship guides and
  organised a meet-and-greet for both successful applicants and guides before the
  conference. Thank you <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> for
  sponsoring this.</p>

<p>
  We did a first round of blind selection and then were conscious during our talk
  selection process to select diverse talks and speakers. This led to last year's
  even 50-50 female-to-male speaker lineup, and we are almost there this year (5
  women speakers vs 7 men speakers).</p>

<p>
  We set up a <a href="http://goruco.com/2016/child-care">child care program</a>,
  free of charge, for anyone who requires it in order to attend our conference.
  Child care is available for the duration of the conference and provided by <a
  href="https://www.sittercity.com/">SitterCity</a>.</p>

<p>
  We lined up a <a href="http://goruco.com/2016/presentation-skills-improv-workshop">presentations skills improv workshop for our
  speakers</a>, where they can practice various activities that address the fear
  of public speaking. The workshop is taught by <a
  href="http://jillfrutkin.com">Jill Frutkin</a>.</p>

<p>
  We are happy with our efforts this year and look forward to
  what we can do even better next year.</p>
