  title: "The Good Bad Bug: Fail Your Way to Better Code"
  description: "<p>Programming history is filled with bugs that turned out to be features and limitations that pushed developers to make even more interesting products. We’ll journey through code that was so ‘bad’ it was actually good. Along the way we&#39;ll look at the important role failure plays in learning. Then we’ll tame our inner perfectionists and tackle an approach to writing code that will help us fail spectacularly on our way to coding success.</p>"
  bio: Jessica Rudder is an engineer at GitHub with a passion for clean code and the Kansas City Royals. She once ran 70 miles through the Santa Monica Mountains "just for fun". When she's not writing code, she can be found running aimlessly through city streets training for her next ultra or creating code-related videos on YouTube for CompChomp. She is an avid squirrel photographer and loves the color green.

  title: Analyzing and Reducing Ruby Memory Usage
  description: "<p>Memory usage can be difficult to analyze.  In this presentation we will cover different techniques for analyzing memory usage of a Ruby process including in-process analysis tools as well as system level tools.  After doing memory analysis, we&#39;ll look at some ways to reduce overall memory used by the system.  Attendees will leave with practical tips and tricks for memory analysis in their Ruby systems, as well as a better understanding of Ruby internals.</p>"
  bio: Aaron is on the Ruby core team, the Rails core team, and the team that takes care of his cat, Gorby puff.  During the day he works for a small technology company called GitHub.  Someday he will find the perfect safety gear to wear while extreme programming.
